                text: This character marries a "minor movingpicture magnate" in Hollywood
                      and divorces him in Mexico five years later. This character washes her
                      mouth out with soap after kissing Charlie; earlier, she wrestles with
                      a brother for kissing "a dirty girl like Natalie." At her father's
                      funeral, this character pays her brother a hundred dollars to see her
                      daughter, whom she later attempts to send two hundred dollars a month.
                      That brother notices her muddy drawers as she climbs a tree, and
                      repeatedly remarks that this character "smells of trees." This
                      character's favorite brother, for whom she names her daughter, thinks
                      of her before committing suicide at Harvard. For 10 points, name this
