                text: Before he first met his lover, this character sat "alone," "enthroned
                      in the market place." A soldier laments that this man, when not
                      himself, "comes too short of that great property / which still should
                      go with" him. This man hands a pack of belongings to a deserter who
                      later laments "I am alone the villain of the earth." This man says
                      "Let's mock the midnight bell" in the hopes of having one last drunken
                      party. This man is spared after a rival argues, "let us be
                      sacrificers, but not butchers."
