                      both the "e-grade" and "o-grade" varieties. In English syntax, this
                      form of complementizer is inherent to the sentence "I think they like
                      me." This type of "derivation" is exemplified by using a noun such as
                      "pen" as a verb, as in "I penned it." In the Chomsky hierarchy,
                      unrestricted grammars are also called "Type-[this]". Arabic and Hebrew

                      escape the murder of his siblings by the title queen so that he may

                text: One reaction of this type reacts alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyls
                      with Hantzsch esters under amine catalysis. Discoverers of an
                      asymmetric version of this reaction used in the industrial synthesis
                      of L-DOPA from an achiral arene won part of the 2001 Nobel Prize in
                      Chemistry. That asymmetric form of this reaction can be catalyzed by
                      ruthenium-BINAP complexes developed by Noyori. A square-planar
                      tris(triphenylphosphine) rhodium(I) complex was developed in 1966 to
                      homogeneously catalyze this reaction;
