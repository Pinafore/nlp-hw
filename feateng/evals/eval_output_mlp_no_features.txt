                text: For any natural number n, there exists only one of these numbers that
                      can be expressed in the form "n-cubed plus 1". Kanold was the first to
                      show that the amount of these numbers below a given integer n had an
                      asymptotic form of little-O of the square root of n. With the
                      exception of the smallest of these, all known so far can be written as
                      the sum of the cubes of consecutive positive odd integers. For a
                      Mersenne prime with exponent p, a number of this type can be found by
                      multiplying the Mersenne prime by 2 to the power p minus 1, according
                      to the Euler-Euclid conjecture. These numbers are a subset of the
                      triangular numbers, and all numbers of this type found so far are
                      even. For 10 points,

                      Kernberg. In an essay on this condition, a University of Rochester
                      historian describes how "the happy hooker" replaced Horatio Alger as
                      the image of success. Robert Raskin and Calvin Hall designed a test
                      for it where subjects choose between statements like "Compliments
                      embarrass me" and "I like to be complimented." In a book subtitled
                      American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations, Christopher Lasch
                      argued that postwar America is defined by a "culture of" this
                      condition. Sigmund Freud's 1914 paper On this conditon popularized its

                      St. John Damascene is sometimes called the "Doctor of" this event due
                      to his three sermons on it. The 4th Glorious Mystery of the Rosary
