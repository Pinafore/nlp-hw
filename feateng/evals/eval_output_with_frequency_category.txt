                      form of complementizer is inherent to the sentence "I think they like
                      me." This type of "derivation" is exemplified by using a noun such as
                      "pen" as a verb, as in "I penned it." In the Chomsky hierarchy,
                      unrestricted grammars are also called "Type-[this]". Arabic and Hebrew
                      use this type of copula in sentences lacking a word for "to be." In
                      linguistics, this term also denotes an inferred word or part of speech

                      and Senoff in 1965. As a ligand, this molecule exhibits weak sigma-
                      donation and strong pi backbonding. When silver(I) [one] oxide is
                      added, this gas is evolved in the Arndt-Eistert homologation of
                      carboxylic acids. When ketones are used as the starting product for
                      the Schmidt reaction, this gas is evolved. This gas is also released
                      as a byproduct of the Sandmeyer reactions. In plants, it binds to a
                      molybdenum-containing enzyme. This gas can be produced by just heating
                      diazonium salts or azides. This gas is often used as an alternative to
                      argon for the creation of inert atmospheres. For 10 points, name this
                      most common gas in Earth's atmosphere.

                      asymptotic form of little-O of the square root of n. With the
                      exception of the smallest of these, all known so far can be written as
                      the sum of the cubes of consecutive positive odd integers. For a
                      Mersenne prime with exponent p, a number of this type can be found by
                      multiplying the Mersenne prime by 2 to the power p minus 1, according
                      to the Euler-Euclid conjecture. These numbers are a subset of the
                      triangular numbers, and all numbers of this type found so far are
                      even. For 10 points, name these numbers, such as 496 and 6, that are
