                text: This character marries a "minor movingpicture magnate" in Hollywood
                      and divorces him in Mexico five years later. This character washes her
                      mouth out with soap after kissing Charlie; earlier, she wrestles with
                      a brother for kissing "a dirty girl like Natalie." At her father's
                      funeral, this character pays her brother a hundred dollars to see her
                      daughter, whom she later attempts to send two hundred dollars a month.
                      That brother notices her muddy drawers as she climbs a tree, and
                      repeatedly remarks that this character "smells of trees." This

                      and Senoff in 1965. As a ligand, this molecule exhibits weak sigma-
                      donation and strong pi backbonding. When silver(I) [one] oxide is
                      added, this gas is evolved in the Arndt-Eistert homologation of
                      carboxylic acids. When ketones are used as the starting product for
                      the Schmidt reaction, this gas is evolved. This gas is also released
