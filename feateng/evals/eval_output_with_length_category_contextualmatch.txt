                text: The nature of this condition was debated by Heinz Kohut and Otto
                      Kernberg. In an essay on this condition, a University of Rochester
                      historian describes how "the happy hooker" replaced Horatio Alger as
                      the image of success. Robert Raskin and Calvin Hall designed a test
                      for it where subjects choose between statements like "Compliments
                      embarrass me" and "I like to be complimented." In a book subtitled
                      American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations, Christopher Lasch
                      argued that postwar America is defined by a "culture of" this
                      condition. Sigmund Freud's 1914 paper On this conditon popularized its
                      name, and DSM-5 includes "largely superficial" relationships and a
