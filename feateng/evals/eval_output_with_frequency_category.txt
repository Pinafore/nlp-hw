                      Kernberg. In an essay on this condition, a University of Rochester
                      historian describes how "the happy hooker" replaced Horatio Alger as
                      the image of success. Robert Raskin and Calvin Hall designed a test
                      for it where subjects choose between statements like "Compliments
                      embarrass me" and "I like to be complimented." In a book subtitled
                      American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations, Christopher Lasch
                      argued that postwar America is defined by a "culture of" this
                      condition. Sigmund Freud's 1914 paper On this conditon popularized its
                      name, and DSM-5 includes "largely superficial" relationships and a
                      "pervasive pattern of grandiosity" among its indicators. For 10

                text: Journalist John Dinges survived this initiative, which he claimed
                      "brought terrorism to three continents" in a 2003 book. The murder of
                      Hugo Banzer set back this initiative, which began two years after the
                      Villa Grimaldi complex opened for use in interrogations. A disclosed
                      diplomatic cable from Robert E. White revealed that this plan made use
                      of a tele-communications channel built by the United States. In
                      Washington, DC, a far-flung part of its "Phase III" targeted Orlando
                      Letelier, a particular nuisance to the DINA agency led by School of
                      the Americas alum Manuel Contreras. This campaign expanded into the
                      "Dirty War" in Jorge Videla's Argentina. For 10 points, name this
                      covert operation in which dictators ring-led by Agusto Pinochet
                      suppressed and killed South American leftists.

                text: A 9th-century letter denying this event, opening with the words
                      "Cogitis me," was written to Paula and Eustochium by a Pseudo-Jerome.
                      St. John Damascene is sometimes called the "Doctor of" this event due
                      to his three sermons on it. The 4th Glorious Mystery of the Rosary
                      contemplates this event, which is traditionally held to have left
                      lilies behind. The latest ex cathedra infallible declaration,
                      Munificentissimus Deus, established this as dogma in 1950 under Pope
                      Pius XII. A feast on August 15 honors
