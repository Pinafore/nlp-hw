                      both the "e-grade" and "o-grade" varieties. In English syntax, this
                      form of complementizer is inherent to the sentence "I think they like
                      me." This type of "derivation" is exemplified by using a noun such as
                      "pen" as a verb, as in "I penned it." In the Chomsky hierarchy,
                      unrestricted grammars are also called "Type-[this]". Arabic and Hebrew
                      use this type of copula in sentences lacking a word for "to be." In
                      linguistics, this term also denotes an inferred word or part of speech
                      that isn't outwardly expressed. For 10 points, identify
