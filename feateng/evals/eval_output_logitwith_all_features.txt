                text: During this king's reign, his general Henri II de Montmorency beat the
                      Spanish at the Battle of Veillane and helped Charles Gonzaga, the Duke
                      of Nevers [nuh-VAIR], secure rule over Mantua. The Counts of
                      MontrÃ©sor and Soissons plotted with this king's brother Gaston in a
                      plot to overthrow him. Jean Guiton was mayor of a city that resisted
                      this man's rule, holding out for 14 months until the signing of the
                      Peace of Alais. Concino Concini advised the mother of this king, who
                      acted as his regent until Charles de Luynes helped bring this king to
                      power. This son of Marie de' Medici and husband of Anne of Austria was
                      advised by a man who besieged the Huguenot city of La Rochelle. For 10
                      points, name this French king who succeeded Henry IV and employed
                      Cardinal Richelieu.
