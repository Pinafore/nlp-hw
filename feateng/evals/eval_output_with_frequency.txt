                      actor's "pro-attitude" must be part of the "primary reason" that
                      causes an action. This author of "A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs"
                      proposed using Tarski's semantic theory of truth as the core for a
                      "theory of meaning," though he later claimed "there is no such thing
                      as a language." He included the "principle of charity," which assumes
                      that another speaker has true beliefs, in a method for understanding
                      unfamiliar speech "from scratch." His alternative to mind-body dualism
                      held that no natural laws connect physical events with mental events.
