Later thinkers built on this work's assertion that a concept is "something universal which serves as a rule." A notable commentary on this work was written by the author of Philosophy of As If, Hans Vaihinger. This work describes how one gains experience from creating a unity out of a manifold, and it presents time and space as the two pure forms of intuition. Of quantity, of quality, of relation, and of modality are the divisions into which this work places the twelve categories of understanding. It attempts to establish the necessity of certain propositions through the transcendental ideas. This work rejects the possibility of metaphysics, though it does show how other synthetic a priori propositions are possible. For 10 points, name this Immanuel Kant work, the first of his critiques.
