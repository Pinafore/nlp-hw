                      St. John Damascene is sometimes called the "Doctor of" this event due
                      to his three sermons on it. The 4th Glorious Mystery of the Rosary
                      contemplates this event, which is traditionally held to have left

                      Munificentissimus Deus, established this as dogma in 1950 under Pope
                      Pius XII. A feast on August 15 honors this event, which in Eastern
                      Orthodox tradition was preceded by a sleep called the Dormition. Like

                      the creation of the Primrose League, which is dedicated to spreading
                      its influence. A document summarizing this party's principles warned
                      that future legislation had potential to cause "a perpetual vortex of
                      agitation." After the elevation of another man to a Lordship, Stafford
                      Northcote led this party in the Commons. This party ran a short-lived
                      government called the "Who? Who?" Ministry under the Earl of Derby,
                      and the Tamworth Manifesto, distinguished it from a predecessor led by
                      the Duke of Wellington. This party was also led by a man who organized
                      Britain's purchase of the Suez Canal and had a rivalry with William
                      Gladstone. For 10 points, name this British political party of Robert

                      a brother for kissing "a dirty girl like Natalie." At her father's
                      funeral, this character pays her brother a hundred dollars to see her
                      daughter, whom she later attempts to send two hundred dollars a month.
                      That brother notices her muddy drawers as she climbs a tree, and
                      repeatedly remarks that this character "smells of trees." This
                      character's favorite brother, for whom she names her daughter, thinks
                      of her before committing suicide at Harvard. For 10 points, name this
                      sister of Jason, Quentin, and Benjy Compson in William Faulkner's The
                      Sound and the Fury.

                text: The nature of this condition was debated by Heinz Kohut and Otto
                      Kernberg. In an essay on this condition, a University of Rochester
                      historian describes how "the happy hooker" replaced Horatio Alger as
                      the image of success. Robert Raskin and Calvin Hall designed a test
                      for it where subjects choose between statements like "Compliments
                      embarrass me" and "I like to be complimented." In a book subtitled
                      American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations, Christopher Lasch
                      argued that postwar America is defined by a "culture of" this
                      condition. Sigmund Freud's 1914 paper On this conditon popularized its
                      name, and DSM-5 includes "largely superficial" relationships and a
                      "pervasive pattern of grandiosity" among its indicators. For 10
                      points, name this disorder of excessive vanity, named for a man
