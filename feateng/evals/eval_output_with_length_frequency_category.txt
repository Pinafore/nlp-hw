                text: Most scholars identify this deity with a figure named Saga who dwells
                      in Sokkvabekk. Along with a servant, this deity helped to heal the
                      horse of Phol. Hlin and Syn serve this figure, who told the women of
                      Winnili to cover their faces with hair, thus helping to found the
                      Lombards. Two other servants of this deity, who ride the horse
                      Hofvarpnir and carry shoes respectively, are Gna and Fulla. At the
                      hall Fensalir, this goddess spins the clouds on a loom. Loki accused
                      this goddess of having affairs with Vili and Ve. After this goddess
                      sent Hermod on a mission to Hel, the giantess Thokk refused to weep
                      for her dead son because this goddess failed to get an oath from
                      mistletoe to remain harmless. For 10 points, name this Norse goddess,
                      the mother of Baldur and wife of Odin.

                      can be expressed in the form "n-cubed plus 1". Kanold was the first to

                      asymptotic form of little-O of the square root of n. With the

                      the sum of the cubes of consecutive positive odd integers. For a

                text: This character marries a "minor movingpicture magnate" in Hollywood
                      and divorces him in Mexico five years later. This character washes her
                      mouth out with soap after kissing Charlie; earlier, she wrestles with
                      a brother for kissing "a dirty girl like Natalie." At her father's
                      funeral, this character pays her brother a hundred dollars to see her
                      daughter, whom she later attempts to send two hundred dollars a month.
                      That brother notices her muddy drawers as she climbs a tree, and
                      repeatedly remarks that this character "smells of trees." This

                text: The nature of this condition was debated by Heinz Kohut and Otto
                      Kernberg. In an essay on this condition, a University of Rochester
                      historian describes how "the happy hooker" replaced Horatio Alger as
                      the image of success. Robert Raskin and Calvin Hall designed a test
                      for it where subjects choose between statements like "Compliments
                      embarrass me" and "I like to be complimented." In a book subtitled
                      American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations, Christopher Lasch
                      argued that postwar America is defined by a "culture of" this
                      condition. Sigmund Freud's 1914 paper On this conditon popularized its
                      name, and DSM-5 includes "largely superficial" relationships and a
                      "pervasive pattern of grandiosity"

                      Dakini, a type of angelic psychopomp. They are propitiated at
                      buildings made of three concentric stone circles of varying height. In
                      a ritual meant to satisfy these creatures, a master known as a rogyapa
                      uses a slicing knife during readings from the Tibetan Book of the
                      Dead. On a peak named for these creatures near Ramnagar, the Heart
                      Sutra and Lotus Sutra were delivered by the Buddha. When not shown as
