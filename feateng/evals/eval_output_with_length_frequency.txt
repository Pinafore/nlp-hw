                      both the "e-grade" and "o-grade" varieties. In English syntax, this
                      form of complementizer is inherent to the sentence "I think they like
                      me." This type of "derivation" is exemplified by using a noun such as
                      "pen" as a verb, as in "I penned it." In the Chomsky hierarchy,
                      unrestricted grammars are also called "Type-[this]". Arabic and Hebrew
                      use this type of copula in sentences lacking a word for "to be." In
                      linguistics, this term also denotes an inferred word or part of speech

                      form of complementizer is inherent to the sentence "I think they like
                      me." This type of "derivation" is exemplified by using a noun such as
                      "pen" as a verb, as in "I penned it." In the Chomsky hierarchy,
                      unrestricted grammars are also called "Type-[this]". Arabic and

                text: Along with five ammonia ligands, this molecule is bonded to a
                      ruthenium(II) [two] metal center in a new complex prepared by Allen
                      and Senoff in 1965. As a ligand, this molecule exhibits weak sigma-
                      donation and strong pi backbonding. When silver(I) [one] oxide is
                      added, this gas is evolved in the Arndt-Eistert homologation of
                      carboxylic acids. When ketones are used as the starting product for
                      the Schmidt reaction, this gas is evolved. This gas is also released
                      as a byproduct of the Sandmeyer reactions.

                      find a dog on the road. This author also wrote a play in which two men

                      off their shifts as prison workers. This man created a teenager who
