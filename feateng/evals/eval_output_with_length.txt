                      St. John Damascene is sometimes called the "Doctor of" this event due
                      to his three sermons on it. The 4th Glorious Mystery of the Rosary

                      that another speaker has true beliefs, in a method for understanding
                      unfamiliar speech "from scratch." His alternative to mind-body dualism

                text: The narrator of this novel becomes fascinated by the story of Margaret
                      and Dolcino after a lecture on love by Ubertino. To prove his skill, a
                      character in this novel discerns the location, appearance, and name of
                      the horse Brunellus without having ever seen it. A man in this work
                      has a vision of the plot of the Cena Cypriani before discovering how
                      to open a mirror and enter the finis Africae. After a trial in this
                      novel, Remigio is burned alongside a village girl and the hunchback
                      Salvatore by the inquisitor Bernard Gui. At the end of this novel, the
                      blind Jorge of Burgos eats the poisoned pages of Aristotle's Second
                      Book of Poetics and burns down the monastery library. For 10 points,
                      name this historical novel following William of Baskerville and Adso
                      of Melk, by Umberto Eco.
