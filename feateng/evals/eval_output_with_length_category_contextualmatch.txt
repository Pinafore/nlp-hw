                text: Along with five ammonia ligands, this molecule is bonded to a
                      ruthenium(II) [two] metal center in a new complex prepared by Allen
                      and Senoff in 1965. As a ligand, this molecule exhibits weak sigma-
                      donation and strong pi backbonding. When silver(I) [one] oxide is
                      added, this gas is evolved in the Arndt-Eistert homologation of
                      carboxylic acids. When ketones are used as the starting product for
                      the Schmidt reaction, this gas is evolved. This gas is also released
                      as a byproduct of the Sandmeyer reactions.

                      historian describes how "the happy hooker" replaced Horatio Alger as
                      the image of success. Robert Raskin and Calvin Hall designed a test
                      for it where subjects choose between statements like "Compliments
                      embarrass me" and "I like to be complimented." In a book subtitled

                      a brother for kissing "a dirty girl like Natalie." At her father's

                      daughter, whom she later attempts to send two hundred dollars a month.
                      That brother notices her muddy drawers as she climbs a tree, and

                      the creation of the Primrose League, which is dedicated to spreading
                      its influence. A document summarizing this party's principles warned
                      that future legislation had potential to cause "a perpetual vortex of
                      agitation." After the elevation of another man to a Lordship, Stafford
                      Northcote led this party in the Commons. This party ran a short-lived
                      government called the "Who? Who?" Ministry under the Earl of Derby,
                      and the Tamworth Manifesto, distinguished it from a predecessor led by
                      the Duke of Wellington. This party was also led by a man who organized

                      Gladstone.
