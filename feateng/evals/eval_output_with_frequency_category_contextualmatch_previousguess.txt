                text: This character faintheartedly commits herself to improving her studies
                      after a night of reading Emerson alone in her house, and hushes Victor
                      when he begins singing "Ah! Si tu savais!" While talking to a friend,
                      she declares that she would give up the "unessential things" for her
                      children, but she wouldn't give herself up. Doctor Mandelet advises
                      this character's husband to permit her whims, which include moving
                      into a "pigeon house" outside of her house on Esplanade Street. This
                      mother of Raoul and Etienne watches Adele Ratignolle give birth on her
                      last night alive, and romances Alcee Arobin and Robert Lebrun while
                      living in New Orleans. For 10 points, name this woman who swims as far
                      as she can into the Gulf of Mexico at the end of Kate Chopin's novel
                      The Awakening.

                text: In Shinto myth, a god's arm turns into an icicle during an instance of
                      this activity when it is used to decide the ruler of Japan by
                      Takemikazuchi and Takeminakata. In the Mahabharata, Krishna uses a
                      blade of grass to demonstrate to Bhima how he can defeat Jarasandha in
                      this activity. A Libyan giant uses the skulls of his victims in this
                      activity to build a temple to his father Poseidon. In the Prose Edda,
                      Elli is an old hag who is able to defeat Thor in this because she is a
                      personification of old age. Atalanta defeats Peleus in this, and
                      Heracles kills a practitioner of it in midair because he

                text: The fondness of a leader of this party for a certain flower inspired
                      the creation of the Primrose League, which is dedicated to spreading
                      its influence. A document summarizing this party's principles warned
                      that future legislation had potential to cause "a perpetual vortex of
                      agitation." After the elevation of another man to a Lordship, Stafford
                      Northcote led this party in the Commons. This party ran a short-lived
                      government called the "Who? Who?" Ministry under the Earl of Derby,
                      and the Tamworth
