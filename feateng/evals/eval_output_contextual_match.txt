                      in Sokkvabekk. Along with a servant, this deity helped to heal the
                      horse of Phol. Hlin and Syn serve this figure, who told the women of
                      Winnili to cover their faces with hair, thus helping to found the
                      Lombards. Two other servants of this deity, who ride the horse
                      Hofvarpnir and carry shoes respectively, are Gna and Fulla. At the
                      hall Fensalir, this goddess spins the clouds on a loom. Loki accused
                      this goddess of having affairs with Vili and Ve. After this goddess

                      Kernberg. In an essay on this condition, a University of Rochester
                      historian describes how "the happy hooker" replaced Horatio Alger as
                      the image of success. Robert Raskin and Calvin Hall designed a test
                      for it where subjects choose between statements like "Compliments
                      embarrass me" and "I like to be complimented." In a book subtitled
                      American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations, Christopher Lasch
                      argued that postwar America is defined by a "culture of" this
                      condition. Sigmund Freud's 1914 paper On this conditon popularized its
                      name, and DSM-5 includes "largely superficial" relationships and a
