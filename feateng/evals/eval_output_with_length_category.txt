                      both the "e-grade" and "o-grade" varieties. In English syntax, this
                      form of complementizer is inherent to the sentence "I think they like
                      me." This type of "derivation" is exemplified by using a noun such as

                text: For any natural number n, there exists only one of these numbers that
                      can be expressed in the form "n-cubed plus 1". Kanold was the first to
                      show that the amount of these numbers below a given integer n had an
                      asymptotic form of little-O of the square root of n. With the
                      exception of the smallest of these, all known so far can be written as
                      the sum of the cubes of consecutive positive odd integers. For a
                      Mersenne prime with exponent p, a number of this type can be found by
                      multiplying the Mersenne prime by 2 to the power p minus 1, according
                      to the Euler-Euclid conjecture. These numbers are a subset of the
                      triangular numbers, and all numbers of this type found so far are
                      even. For 10 points,
