                text: Some Vajrayana Buddhists consider these real-world creatures to be
                      Dakini, a type of angelic psychopomp. They are propitiated at
                      buildings made of three concentric stone circles of varying height. In
                      a ritual meant to satisfy these creatures, a master known as a rogyapa
                      uses a slicing knife during readings from the Tibetan Book of the
                      Dead. On a peak named for these creatures near Ramnagar, the Heart
                      Sutra and Lotus Sutra were delivered by the Buddha. When not shown as
                      an eagle, Garuda's brother Jatayu is one of these creatures, whose
                      recent chemical-caused extinction around Mumbai has threatened

                      in Sokkvabekk. Along with a servant, this deity helped to heal the
                      horse of Phol. Hlin and Syn serve this figure, who told the women of
                      Winnili to cover their faces with hair, thus helping to found the
                      Lombards. Two other servants of this deity, who ride the horse
                      Hofvarpnir and carry shoes respectively, are Gna and Fulla. At the
                      hall Fensalir, this goddess spins the clouds on a loom. Loki accused
                      this goddess of having affairs with Vili and Ve. After this goddess
                      sent Hermod on a mission to Hel, the giantess Thokk refused to weep
                      for her dead son because this goddess failed to get an oath from

                      both the "e-grade" and "o-grade" varieties. In English syntax, this
                      form of complementizer is inherent to the sentence "I think they like
                      me." This type of "derivation" is exemplified by using a noun such as
                      "pen" as a verb, as in "I penned it." In the Chomsky hierarchy,
                      unrestricted grammars are also called "Type-[this]". Arabic and Hebrew
                      use this type of copula in sentences lacking a word for "to be." In
