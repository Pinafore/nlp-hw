                      both the "e-grade" and "o-grade" varieties. In English syntax, this
                      form of complementizer is inherent to the sentence "I think they like
                      me." This type of "derivation" is exemplified by using a noun such as
                      "pen" as a verb, as in "I penned it." In the Chomsky hierarchy,
                      unrestricted grammars are also called "Type-[this]". Arabic and Hebrew
                      use this type of copula in sentences lacking a word for "to be." In
                      linguistics, this term also denotes an inferred word or part of speech

                      after a night of reading Emerson alone in her house, and hushes Victor

                      children, but she wouldn't give herself up. Doctor Mandelet advises
                      this character's husband to permit her whims, which include moving
                      into a "pigeon house" outside of her house on Esplanade Street. This
