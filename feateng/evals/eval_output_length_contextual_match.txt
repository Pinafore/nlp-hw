                      both the "e-grade" and "o-grade" varieties. In English syntax, this
                      form of complementizer is inherent to the sentence "I think they like
                      me." This type of "derivation" is exemplified by using a noun such as
                      "pen" as a verb, as in "I penned it." In the Chomsky hierarchy,
                      unrestricted grammars are also called "Type-[this]". Arabic and Hebrew

                      the creation of the Primrose League, which is dedicated to spreading
                      its influence. A document summarizing this party's principles warned
                      that future legislation had potential to cause "a perpetual vortex of
                      agitation." After the elevation of another man to a Lordship, Stafford
                      Northcote led this party in the Commons. This party ran a short-lived
                      government called the "Who? Who?" Ministry under the Earl of Derby,
                      and the Tamworth Manifesto, distinguished it from a predecessor led by
                      the Duke of Wellington. This party was also led by a man who organized
                      Britain's purchase of the Suez Canal and had a rivalry with William
                      Gladstone.
