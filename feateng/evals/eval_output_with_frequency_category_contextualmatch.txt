                      can be expressed in the form "n-cubed plus 1". Kanold was the first to
                      show that the amount of these numbers below a given integer n had an
                      asymptotic form of little-O of the square root of n. With the
                      exception of the smallest of these, all known so far can be written as
                      the sum of the cubes of consecutive positive odd integers.

                text: A 9th-century letter denying this event, opening with the words
                      "Cogitis me," was written to Paula and Eustochium by a Pseudo-Jerome.
                      St. John Damascene is sometimes called the "Doctor of" this event due
                      to his three sermons on it. The 4th Glorious Mystery of the Rosary
                      contemplates this event, which is traditionally held to have left
                      lilies behind. The latest ex cathedra infallible declaration,
                      Munificentissimus Deus, established this as dogma in 1950 under Pope
                      Pius XII. A feast on August 15 honors this event, which in Eastern
                      Orthodox tradition was preceded by a sleep called the Dormition. Like
                      Jesus's resurrection, it left behind an empty tomb. For 10 points,

                text: Most scholars identify this deity with a figure named Saga who dwells
                      in Sokkvabekk. Along with a servant, this deity helped to heal the
                      horse of Phol. Hlin and Syn serve this figure, who told the women of
                      Winnili to cover their faces with hair, thus helping to found the
                      Lombards. Two other servants of this deity, who ride the horse
                      Hofvarpnir and carry shoes respectively, are Gna and Fulla. At the
                      hall Fensalir, this goddess spins the clouds on a loom. Loki accused
                      this goddess of having affairs with Vili and Ve. After this goddess
                      sent Hermod on a mission to Hel, the giantess Thokk refused to weep
                      for her dead son because this goddess failed to get an oath from
                      mistletoe to remain harmless. For 10 points, name this Norse goddess,
                      the mother of Baldur and wife of Odin.
