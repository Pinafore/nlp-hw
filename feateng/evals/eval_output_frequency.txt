                      Llaes Gyfnewid. Along with a staff and a platter, Bran gives one to

                      the fishing trip in which Thor hooks Jormungand. Hymir owns a massive
                      one of these that the gods bring to Aegir's feast for brewing beer. In

                      of poetry.
