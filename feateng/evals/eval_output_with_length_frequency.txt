                      after a night of reading Emerson alone in her house, and hushes Victor
                      when he begins singing "Ah! Si tu savais!" While talking to a friend,
                      she declares that she would give up the "unessential things" for her

                text: One of these objects is owned by a giant whose wife births a fully
                      armed son every six weeks. That owner of one of these objects, who
                      escapes a plot to roast him alive in an iron house, is named Llasar
                      Llaes Gyfnewid. Along with a staff and a platter, Bran gives one to
                      Matholwch as reparations, which Efnisien sacrifices himself to destroy
                      and stop it from resurrecting the Irish dead. A non-Odin father of Tyr
                      owns one of these objects, which was retrieved in a quest including
                      the fishing trip in which Thor hooks Jormungand. Hymir owns a massive
                      one of these that the gods bring to Aegir's feast for brewing beer. In
                      one named Odrerir, Kvasir's blood is mixed with honey to make the mead
                      of poetry. For 10 points, name these metal objects in which Ceridwen
                      and other legendary witches brew potions.
