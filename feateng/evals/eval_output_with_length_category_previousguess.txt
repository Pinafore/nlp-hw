                      can be expressed in the form "n-cubed plus 1". Kanold was the first to
                      show that the amount of these numbers below a given integer n had an
                      asymptotic form of little-O of the square root of n. With the
                      exception of the smallest of these, all known so far can be written as
                      the sum of the cubes of consecutive positive odd integers. For a

                text: Along with five ammonia ligands, this molecule is bonded to a
                      ruthenium(II) [two] metal center in a new complex prepared by Allen
                      and Senoff in 1965. As a ligand, this molecule exhibits weak sigma-
                      donation and strong pi backbonding. When silver(I) [one] oxide is
                      added, this gas is evolved in the Arndt-Eistert homologation of
                      carboxylic acids. When ketones are used as the starting product for
                      the Schmidt reaction, this gas is evolved. This gas is also released
                      as a byproduct of the Sandmeyer reactions. In plants, it binds to a
                      molybdenum-containing enzyme. This gas can be produced by just heating
