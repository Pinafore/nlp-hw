                      both the "e-grade" and "o-grade" varieties. In English syntax, this
                      form of complementizer is inherent to the sentence "I think they like
                      me." This type of "derivation" is exemplified by using a noun such as
                      "pen" as a verb, as in "I penned it." In the Chomsky hierarchy,
                      unrestricted grammars are also called "Type-[this]". Arabic and Hebrew
                      use this type of copula in sentences lacking a word for "to be." In
                      linguistics, this term also denotes an inferred word or part of speech

                      Peace of Alais. Concino Concini advised the mother of this king, who
                      acted as his regent until Charles de Luynes helped bring this king to
                      power. This son of Marie de' Medici and husband of Anne of Austria was
                      advised by a man who besieged the Huguenot city of La Rochelle. For 10

                text: Along with five ammonia ligands, this molecule is bonded to a
                      ruthenium(II) [two] metal center in a new complex prepared by Allen
                      and Senoff in 1965. As a ligand, this molecule exhibits weak sigma-
                      donation and strong pi backbonding. When silver(I) [one] oxide is
                      added, this gas is evolved in the Arndt-Eistert homologation of
                      carboxylic acids. When ketones are used as the starting product for
                      the Schmidt reaction, this gas is evolved. This gas is also released
                      as a byproduct of the Sandmeyer reactions.
