                      can be expressed in the form "n-cubed plus 1". Kanold was the first to
                      show that the amount of these numbers below a given integer n had an
                      asymptotic form of little-O of the square root of n. With the
                      exception of the smallest of these, all known so far can be written as
                      the sum of the cubes of consecutive positive odd integers. For a
                      Mersenne prime with exponent p, a number of this type can be found by
                      multiplying the Mersenne prime by 2 to the power p minus 1, according
                      to the Euler-Euclid conjecture. These numbers are a subset of the
                      triangular numbers, and all numbers of this type found so far are

                text: This character marries a "minor movingpicture magnate" in Hollywood
                      and divorces him in Mexico five years later. This character washes her
                      mouth out with soap after kissing Charlie; earlier, she wrestles with
                      a brother for kissing "a dirty girl like Natalie." At her father's
                      funeral, this character pays her brother a hundred dollars to see her
                      daughter, whom she later attempts to send two hundred dollars a month.
                      That brother notices her muddy drawers as she climbs a tree, and
                      repeatedly remarks that this character "smells of trees." This
                      character's favorite brother, for whom she names her daughter, thinks
                      of her before committing suicide at Harvard. For 10 points, name this
                      sister of Jason,

                text: One reaction of this type reacts alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyls
                      with Hantzsch esters under amine catalysis. Discoverers of an
                      asymmetric version of this reaction used in the industrial synthesis
                      of L-DOPA from an achiral arene won part of the 2001 Nobel Prize in
                      Chemistry. That asymmetric form of this reaction can be catalyzed by
                      ruthenium-BINAP complexes developed by Noyori. A square-planar
                      tris(triphenylphosphine) rhodium(I) complex was developed in 1966 to
                      homogeneously catalyze this reaction;
