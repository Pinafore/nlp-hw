                      Takemikazuchi and Takeminakata. In the Mahabharata, Krishna uses a

                      Elli is an old hag who is able to defeat Thor in this because she is a
                      personification of old age. Atalanta defeats Peleus in this, and

                      St. John Damascene is sometimes called the "Doctor of" this event due
