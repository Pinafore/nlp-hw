                      Dakini, a type of angelic psychopomp. They are propitiated at
                      buildings made of three concentric stone circles of varying height. In
                      a ritual meant to satisfy these creatures, a master known as a rogyapa
                      uses a slicing knife during readings from the Tibetan Book of the
                      Dead. On a peak named for these creatures near Ramnagar, the Heart
                      Sutra and Lotus Sutra were delivered by the Buddha. When not shown as
                      an eagle, Garuda's brother Jatayu is one of these creatures, whose
                      recent chemical-caused extinction around Mumbai has threatened the use
                      of dakhmas there by Parsis. For 10 points, name these birds which come
