                      and Senoff in 1965. As a ligand, this molecule exhibits weak sigma-
                      donation and strong pi backbonding. When silver(I) [one] oxide is
                      added, this gas is evolved in the Arndt-Eistert homologation of
                      carboxylic acids. When ketones are used as the starting product for
                      the Schmidt reaction, this gas is evolved. This gas is also released
                      as a byproduct of the Sandmeyer reactions.
