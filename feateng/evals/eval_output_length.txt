                      in Sokkvabekk. Along with a servant, this deity helped to heal the
                      horse of Phol. Hlin and Syn serve this figure, who told the women of
                      Winnili to cover their faces with hair, thus helping to found the
                      Lombards. Two other servants of this deity, who ride the horse
                      Hofvarpnir and carry shoes respectively, are Gna and Fulla. At the
                      hall Fensalir, this goddess spins the clouds on a loom. Loki accused
                      this goddess of having affairs with Vili and Ve. After this goddess
                      sent Hermod on a mission to Hel, the giantess Thokk refused to weep
                      for her dead son because this goddess failed to get an oath from
                      mistletoe to remain harmless.
