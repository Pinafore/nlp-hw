                      Dakini, a type of angelic psychopomp. They are propitiated at
                      buildings made of three concentric stone circles of varying height. In
                      a ritual meant to satisfy these creatures, a master known as a rogyapa
                      uses a slicing knife during readings from the Tibetan Book of the
