                      ruthenium(II) [two] metal center in a new complex prepared by Allen
                      and Senoff in 1965. As a ligand, this molecule exhibits weak sigma-
                      donation and strong pi backbonding. When silver(I) [one] oxide is
                      added, this gas is evolved in the Arndt-Eistert homologation of
                      carboxylic acids. When ketones are used as the starting product for
                      the Schmidt reaction, this gas is evolved. This gas is also released
                      as a byproduct of the Sandmeyer reactions. In plants, it binds to a
                      molybdenum-containing enzyme. This gas can be produced by just heating
                      diazonium salts or azides. This gas is often used as an alternative to
